## What we will cover
This documentation will take you through the steps to create a local "play" version of Sakai on a VM (virtual machine). In particular it will 
show you how to configure a Vagrant box using VirtualBox with an Ubuntu Linux install. At the end, on the one virtual box, you should be able
to run any version of Sakai you wish, going back to 11.0 . (Pre-Sakai 11 the source code was stored in SVN aka subversion, which requires a different set of instructions).
An interesting thing about a git repository is that it contains by default every branch and tag. Therefore downloading a forked version of the Sakai
repository means you've downloaded every version of Sakai since 11.0 .  You will only need one database application, MySQL in this case, which can
contain a separate database for each version of Sakai you wish to use. These instructions should work on Mac or Windows. 

## Install Virtualbox
